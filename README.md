# Lunar-Gravity-Assist-Patched-Conic-Simulation
Hi Im Matthew Slater a recent graduate in space engineering this is a reposatory for previous projects done at university and to be used as part of a job application. This repo contains the MATLAB code used as part of my masters using a novel patched conics approximation method the V infinity Sphere to look at earth-earth lunar gravity assists
